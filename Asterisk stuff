################################ Configuring Asterisk To Provide Ring-back #########################

If you are having issues getting your Asterisk Server to provide Ring-back to your customers then there are some simple settings we need to configure. 

If you are using Asterisk with NO GUI then all you have to edit is the sip.conf file usually found in /etc/asterisk/
Once you are in the sip.conf please add these values to the general category:
prematuremedia=no
progressinband=yes

Once this has been done make sure to save and restart your asterisk server. Usually its done by running this in your terminal: service asterisk restart
Your PBX should now be providing ring-back to your end-customers. 


If you are using a GUI like FreePBX then you will need to do two things.

1. Under your PEER Details in trunk settings add these two values:
prematuremedia=no
progressinband=yes

2. Next, edit file: sip_general_custom.conf usually found in /etc/asterisk/ and add these two values at the top:
prematuremedia=no
progressinband=yes

Make sure to save your settings. Once saved - restart the Asterisk service.
Your PBX should now be providing ring-back to your end-customers.
